13.It plays a role in developing energy-efficient and sustainable software solutions for environmental impact.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Advent of High-level programming languages (1950s-1060s)
    The development of high-level programming lamguages such as FORTRAN (1957) and  COBOL (1959), marked a major shift in software engineering.These languages allowed developers to write 
    code that was closer to Human language,rather than machine code, making programming more accessible and efficient. This milestone significantly increased productivity and enabled 
    more complex software systems to be developed.It also laid the groundwork for modern programming languages and software development practices by abstracting the underlying hardware 
    details.
2. The Introduction of Structured programming(1960s-1970s)
    Structured programming emerged as a solution to the 'Software crisis' of the 1960s,where increasing complexities led to unimaginable and
   error-prone software. Pionered by Edsger  Dijkstra and others ,structured programming emphasized the use of control structures like loops,
   conditionals and subroutines, and discouraged the use of "goto" statements.This approach made programs easier to understand debug,and
   maintain,which greatly improved software quality and reliability. Structured programming laid the foundation for later software engineering
   methodologies and was a key step towards more formalized approaches to software development.
3. The Emergence of Agile Methodologies(1990s-2000s)
    Agile methodologies including Scrum,Extreme Programming ( XP), and later Kanban, emerged in response to the limitations of traditional,
   rigid software development processes like the Waterfall model.Agile focuses on iterative development,collaboration,flexibility,and
   customer feedback,allowing teams to adapt to changes more effectively. Agile revolutionized software engineering by emphasizing rapid,
   incremental releases and continuous improvement.It has become one of the most widely adopted approaches in the industry,enabling faster
  delivery of software,better alignment with user needs, and greater adaptability in a rapidly changing technology landscape.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning
2.Requirement Analysis
3.Design
4.Implementation( Coding)
5.Testing
6.Deployment
7.Maintenance

1.Planning
   In this initial phase,the project's scope,objectives,and feasibility are determined.It involves gathering requirements,estimating
   resources,and defining timelines.
2.Requirement Analysis
    This phase focuses on gathering and analyzing the specific requirements of the software.It includes detailed documentation of the
    functional and non-functional requirements.
3.Design
   The system and software design are prepared based on the requirements.This phase involves creating architecture,data models,and userinterfaces that guides the development process.
4.Implementation( Coding)
   The actual code is written in this phase according to the design specifications.Developers build the software by translating the  design into source code.
5.Testing
  The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs or issues.It involves various testing,integration testing,system testing,and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6.Deployment
  After testing,the software is deployed to the production environment where it becomes accessible to end users.This phase may include  installation,configuration,and user training.
7.Maintenance
  Post-deployment,the software enters the maintenance phase.It involves regular updates,bug fixes,performance improvements,and sometimesthe addition of new features to ensure  the software continues to meet users' needs.
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 COMPARISON
1.Approach
  Waterfall is more rigid and plan-driven,suitable for projects with fixed requirements,Agile is adaptive and value-driven,ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve.
2.Documentation
  Waterfall emphasizes detailed documentaton,whereas Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation.
3.Flexibility
  Waterfall is less flexible,while Agile is highly flexible,allowing changes to be made throughout the development process.
   CONTRAST
1.Predictability vs. Flexibility
  Waterfall offers predictability with a clear plan and timeline,but at the cost of flexibility.Agile,in contrast,offers flexibilty and adaptability,but may result in less predictability in terms of final scope and timeline.
2.Customer involvement
  Waterfall typically involves the custmer mainly at the beginning and end of the project.In contrast,Agile requires continuous customer involvement,with regular feedback and iterations.
   EXAMPLES OF SCENARIO
   Waterfall Scenario
   1. Building a Hospital Management System
     Why:In a project like this,where requirements are likely to be well-defined from the start,and changes are minimal,the waterfall approach works well.The critical nature of 
   healthcare data and operations requires thorough documentation and apredictable,linear development process to ensure all aspets are carefully planned and executed.
   Agile Scenario
  2. Developing a mobile Aapp for social media.
     Why:Social media appa often involve rapidly changing user preferences and frequent updates to features.Agile is ideal here as itallows the development team to respond to user 
    feedback,add new features incrementally,and adjust the product to meet evolving market demands quickly.

  3.Eclipse.
 IMPORTANNCE OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS(VCS)
 1.Code management and collaboration:
 a.Version tracking:VCSs track changes made to the codebase over time,allowing developers to see who made what changes and when.This is essential for collaoration as it ensure that changes from multiple developers can be integrated smoothly. 
 b.Branching and merging:VCSs allow developers to create brancches for new features, bug fixes,or experiment without affecting the main codebase,Once changes are stable,they can be merged back into the main branch,ensuring that the codebase remain funtional and Up-to-date.
 2.Backup and Recovery:
 a.Safety net:By storing historical versions of the code,VCSs allow developers to revert to previous version if something goes wrong.This provide a safety net that protect against data loss,accidental deletion,or introducing bugs.
 b. Change History.VSCs maintain a detailed history of changes,which can be invaluable for understandimg the evolution of a project,tracking down the introduction of bugs or reviewing past decisions.
 3.Collaboration ACROSS TEAM:
 a.Distributed development:In distributed version control syStems,(DVCS) like Git,each developer has a full copy of the repository,anabling work offline and integration with the main codebase when back online.This support collaboration across different time zones and locations.
 b.Conflict resolution: VCSs provides tools to resolve conflict that arise when multiple developer make changes to the same part of the code.This helps maintain code integrity and reduces the risk of overwriting others'work.
 4.Continous integration and deployment(CI/CD):
 Automation:VSCs integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing,building,and deploying code whenever changes are push to the repository.This ensure that the codebase is always in a deployable state and reduces the time between writing code and getting it into production.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
PROMPT ENGINEERING: is the process of crafting and optimizing prompts -specific inputs or instructions-designed to elicit the desired output from AI model,paticularly language models like GPT.A prompt can be a question,a statement,or any form of input that guides the AI in generating a response.
 IMPORTANCE:
 1.Maximizing Accuracy and Relevance:A well crafted prompt ensures that the AI model provides accurate,relevant and contextually appropriate 
 responses.Poorly constructed prompts can lead to vague,incomplete or incorrect output,reducing the utility of the AI.
 2.Context and Clarity: The way a prompt is phrased can significantly impact how the AI interprete the task.Prompt engineering involves providing clear ,precise,and context rich prompts to minimize ambiguity and guide the model towards the intended outcome.
 3.Handling complex queries:For complex or multi step tasks,prompt engineering can invole breaking down the queries into smaller,more manageable parts or using iterative prompts to lead the model through a logical sequence of steps.
 4.Bias mitigation: Thoughtful prompt engineering can help mitigaae biases in AI responses by carefully selecting words and context that reduce the likelihood of biased outputs.It also involve avoiding triggers that might lead the models to generate inappropriate or harmful content.
 5.Enhancing creativity and innovation:In creative task,such as generating ideas,stories,or art,prompt engineering can be use to inspire innovative output by setting the right tone,providing creative constraints,or fraiming the task in novel ways.
 
 Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt example:Tell me something about technology.
Improve Prompt: Explain the impsct of artificial intelligent on modern healthcare,focusing on patient diagnosis and treatment.
WHY THE IMPROVE PROMT IS MORE EFFECTIVE.
1.Clarity:The improve prompt is clear about the topic ("Artificial intelligence") and the specific area of interest("Modern healthcare").This eliminate any ambiguity about what aspect of technology the user is asking about.
2:Specificity:, Instead of a broad requst for infomation on 'technology'the improved prompt focuses on a specific application of technology(AI) and a particular industry(Healthcare) this guide the AI to generate a moe targeted and relevant response.
3.Conciseness: The improved prompt is concise yet detailed enough to guide the AI effectively.It avoid unnecessary words,while clearly stating what the user wants to know.
4.Effectiveness: By being clear and specific, the improved prompt helps the AI generate a more informative and relevant responses.It reduces the likelihood of receiving a broad or unfocused answer,making the interaction more productive and useful.
